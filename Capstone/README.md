# Capstone Project Overview

Welcome to the RCET Capstone Project! This guide explains how the capstone course works, what’s expected of you, and how you’ll be graded. This is a **group project** with **individual grading** based on your personal contributions, documentation, and professionalism.

---

## Objective

The Capstone Project is your opportunity to apply everything you’ve learned to solve a real engineering problem. You’ll plan, design, build, test, and document a project from start to finish, just like you would in industry.

---

## Project Assignment

- Each student (or team lead) receives a **unique project** assignment.
- You may be working **alone or with a team**, depending on class size.
- Depending on class size and project availability, you may be assigned **team members** and function as the **team leader**.

## Team Lead Responsibilities 

If you're the team lead:
- You’re responsible for assigning and tracking tasks for your team.
- You must have **95% of your parts list and design complete** before your team is assigned.
- Be prepared to manage workflow, mentor teammates, and make final decisions.
- Expect to submit **your own report, presentation, and weekly logs** even if working with others.
